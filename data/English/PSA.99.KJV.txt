1The Lord reigneth; let the people tremble: he sitteth between the cherubims; let the earth be moved.
2The Lord is great in Zion; and he is high above all the people.
3Let them praise thy great and terrible name; for it is holy.
4The king's strength also loveth judgment; thou dost establish equity, thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob.
5Exalt ye the Lord our God, and worship at his footstool; for he is holy.
6Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call upon his name; they called upon the Lord, and he answered them.
7He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar: they kept his testimonies, and the ordinance that he gave them.
8Thou answeredst them, O Lord our God: thou wast a God that forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions.
9Exalt the Lord our God, and worship at his holy hill; for the Lord our God is holy.
