4The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; therefore shall he beg in harvest, and have nothing.
5Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water; but a man of understanding will draw it out.
6Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness: but a faithful man who can find?
7The just man walketh in his integrity: his children are blessed after him.
8A king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away all evil with his eyes.
9Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin?
10Divers weights, and divers measures, both of them are alike abomination to the Lord.
11Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work be pure, and whether it be right.
12The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the Lord hath made even both of them.
13Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes, and thou shalt be satisfied with bread.
14It is naught, it is naught, saith the buyer: but when he is gone his way, then he boasteth.
15There is gold, and a multitude of rubies: but the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel.
16Take his garment that is surety for a stranger: and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.
17Bread of deceit is sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel.

19He that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets: therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips.
20Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness.
21An inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning; but the end thereof shall not be blessed.
22Say not thou, I will recompense evil; but wait on the Lord, and he shall save thee.

24Man's goings are of the Lord; how can a man then understand his own way?
25It is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is holy, and after vows to make enquiry.
26A wise king scattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over them.
27The spirit of man is the candle of the Lord, searching all the inward parts of the belly.
28Mercy and truth preserve the king: and his throne is upholden by mercy.
29The glory of young men is their strength: and the beauty of old men is the gray head.
30The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil: so do stripes the inward parts of the belly.
