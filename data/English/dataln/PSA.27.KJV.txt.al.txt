1  The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the Lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? 

2  When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell. 

3  Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear: though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident. 

4  One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to enquire in his temple. 

5  For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock. 

6  And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the Lord. 

7  Hear, O Lord, when I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon me, and answer me. 

8  When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy face, Lord, will I seek. 

9  Hide not thy face far from me; put not thy servant away in anger: thou hast been my help; leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation. 

10  When my father and my mother forsake me, then the Lord will take me up. 

11  Teach me thy way, O Lord, and lead me in a plain path, because of mine enemies. 

12  Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies: for false witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out cruelty. 

13  I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living. 

14  Wait on the Lord: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the Lord.
