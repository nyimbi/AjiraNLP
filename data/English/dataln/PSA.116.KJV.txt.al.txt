1  I love the Lord, because he hath heard my voice and my supplications. 

2  Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live. 

3  The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow. 

4  Then called I upon the name of the Lord; O Lord, I beseech thee, deliver my soul. 

5  Gracious is the Lord, and righteous; yea, our God is merciful. 

6  The Lord preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he helped me. 

7  Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee. 

8  For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling. 

9  I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living. 

10  I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted: 

11  I said in my haste, All men are liars. 

12  What shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits toward me? 

13  I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord. 

14  I will pay my vows unto the Lord now in the presence of all his people. 

15  Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints. 

16  O Lord, truly I am thy servant; I am thy servant, and the son of thine handmaid: thou hast loosed my bonds. 

17  I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of the Lord. 

18  I will pay my vows unto the Lord now in the presence of all his people, 

19  In the courts of the Lord's house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise ye the Lord.
