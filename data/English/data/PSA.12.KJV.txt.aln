To the chief Musician upon Sheminith, A Psalm of David.


1  Help, Lord; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men.


2  They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: with flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak.


3  The Lord shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that speaketh proud things:


4  Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are our own: who is lord over us?


5  For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the Lord; I will set him in safety from him that puffeth at him.


6  The words of the Lord are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.


7  Thou shalt keep them, O Lord, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever.


8  The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted.
