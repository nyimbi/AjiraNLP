A Psalm of praise.


1  Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all ye lands.


2  Serve the Lord with gladness: come before his presence with singing.


3  Know ye that the Lord he is God: it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.


4  Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name.


5  For the Lord is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth endureth to all generations.
