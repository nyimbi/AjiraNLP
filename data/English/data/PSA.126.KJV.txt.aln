A Song of degrees.


1  When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream.


2  Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The Lord hath done great things for them.


3  The Lord hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad.


4  Turn again our captivity, O Lord, as the streams in the south.


5  They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.


6  He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.
