1These are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out.
2It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings is to search out a matter.
3The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings is unsearchable.
4Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer.
5Take away the wicked from before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness.
6Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great men:
7For better it is that it be said unto thee, Come up hither; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen.
8Go not forth hastily to strive, lest thou know not what to do in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame.
9Debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself; and discover not a secret to another:
10Lest he that heareth it put thee to shame, and thine infamy turn not away.
11A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver.
12As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear.
13As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of his masters.
14Whoso boasteth himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind without rain.
15By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh the bone.
16Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee, lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it.
17Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour's house; lest he be weary of thee, and so hate thee.
18A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour is a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.
19Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.
20As he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, and as vinegar upon nitre, so is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart.
21If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink:
22For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the Lord shall reward thee.
23The north wind driveth away rain: so doth an angry countenance a backbiting tongue.
24It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman and in a wide house.
25As cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far country.
26A righteous man falling down before the wicked is as a troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring.
27It is not good to eat much honey: so for men to search their own glory is not glory.
28He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down, and without walls.
