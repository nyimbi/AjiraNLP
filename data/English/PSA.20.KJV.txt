To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.
1The Lord hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob defend thee;
2Send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of Zion;
3Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice; Selah.
4Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy counsel.
5We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up our banners: the Lord fulfil all thy petitions.
6Now know I that the Lord saveth his anointed; he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand.
7Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the name of the Lord our God.
8They are brought down and fallen: but we are risen, and stand upright.
9Save, Lord: let the king hear us when we call.
