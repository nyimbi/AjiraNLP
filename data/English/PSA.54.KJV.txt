To the chief Musician on Neginoth, Maschil, A Psalm of David, when the Ziphites came and said to Saul, Doth not David hide himself with us?
1Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength.
2Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.
3For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek after my soul: they have not set God before them. Selah.
4Behold, God is mine helper: the Lord is with them that uphold my soul.
5He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in thy truth.
6I will freely sacrifice unto thee: I will praise thy name, O Lord; for it is good.
7For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: and mine eye hath seen his desire upon mine enemies.
