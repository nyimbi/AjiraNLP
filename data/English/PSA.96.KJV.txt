1O sing unto the Lord a new song: sing unto the Lord, all the earth.
2Sing unto the Lord, bless his name; shew forth his salvation from day to day.
3Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all people.
4For the Lord is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to be feared above all gods.
5For all the gods of the nations are idols: but the Lord made the heavens.
6Honour and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.
7Give unto the Lord, O ye kindreds of the people, give unto the Lord glory and strength.
8Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come into his courts.
9O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness: fear before him, all the earth.
10Say among the heathen that the Lord reigneth: the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people righteously.
11Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof.
12Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein: then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice
13Before the Lord: for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people with his truth.
