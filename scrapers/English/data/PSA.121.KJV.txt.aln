A Song of degrees.


1  I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help.


2  My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth.


3  He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will not slumber.


4  Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.


5  The Lord is thy keeper: the Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand.


6  The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.


7  The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul.


8  The Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and even for evermore.
