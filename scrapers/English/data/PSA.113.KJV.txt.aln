1  Praise ye the Lord. Praise, O ye servants of the Lord, praise the name of the Lord.


2  Blessed be the name of the Lord from this time forth and for evermore.


3  From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the Lord's name is to be praised.


4  The Lord is high above all nations, and his glory above the heavens.


5  Who is like unto the Lord our God, who dwelleth on high,


6  Who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven, and in the earth!


7  He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill;


8  That he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people.


9  He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of children. Praise ye the Lord.
