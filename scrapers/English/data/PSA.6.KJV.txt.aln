To the chief Musician on Neginoth upon Sheminith, A Psalm of David.


1  O Lord, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.


2  Have mercy upon me, O Lord; for I am weak: O Lord, heal me; for my bones are vexed.


3  My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O Lord, how long?


4  Return, O Lord, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies' sake.


5  For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks?


6  I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears.


7  Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of all mine enemies.


8  Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping.


9  The Lord hath heard my supplication; the Lord will receive my prayer.


10  Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return and be ashamed suddenly.
