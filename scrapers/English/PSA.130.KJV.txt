A Song of degrees.
1Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O Lord.
2Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications.
3If thou, Lord, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?
4But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared.
5I wait for the Lord, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope.
6My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning: I say, more than they that watch for the morning.
7Let Israel hope in the Lord: for with the Lord there is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption.
8And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.
