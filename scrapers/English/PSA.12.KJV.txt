To the chief Musician upon Sheminith, A Psalm of David.
1Help, Lord; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men.
2They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: with flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak.
3The Lord shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that speaketh proud things:
4Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are our own: who is lord over us?
5For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the Lord; I will set him in safety from him that puffeth at him.
6The words of the Lord are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.
7Thou shalt keep them, O Lord, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever.
8The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted.
