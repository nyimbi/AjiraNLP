1Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake.
2Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is now their God?
3But our God is in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath pleased.
4Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.
5They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they see not:
6They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they smell not:
7They have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they walk not: neither speak they through their throat.
8They that make them are like unto them; so is every one that trusteth in them.
9O Israel, trust thou in the Lord: he is their help and their shield.
10O house of Aaron, trust in the Lord: he is their help and their shield.
11Ye that fear the Lord, trust in the Lord: he is their help and their shield.
12The Lord hath been mindful of us: he will bless us; he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron.
13He will bless them that fear the Lord, both small and great.
14The Lord shall increase you more and more, you and your children.
15Ye are blessed of the Lord which made heaven and earth.
16The heaven, even the heavens, are the Lord's: but the earth hath he given to the children of men.
17The dead praise not the Lord, neither any that go down into silence.
18But we will bless the Lord from this time forth and for evermore. Praise the Lord.
