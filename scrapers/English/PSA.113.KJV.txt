1Praise ye the Lord. Praise, O ye servants of the Lord, praise the name of the Lord.
2Blessed be the name of the Lord from this time forth and for evermore.
3From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the Lord's name is to be praised.
4The Lord is high above all nations, and his glory above the heavens.
5Who is like unto the Lord our God, who dwelleth on high,
6Who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven, and in the earth!
7He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill;
8That he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people.
9He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of children. Praise ye the Lord.
