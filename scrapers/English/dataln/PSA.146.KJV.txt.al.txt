1  Praise ye the Lord. Praise the Lord, O my soul. 

2  While I live will I praise the Lord: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being. 

3  Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help. 

4  His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish. 

5  Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the Lord his God: 

6  Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein is: which keepeth truth for ever: 

7  Which executeth judgment for the oppressed: which giveth food to the hungry. The Lord looseth the prisoners: 

8  The Lord openeth the eyes of the blind: the Lord raiseth them that are bowed down: the Lord loveth the righteous: 

9  The Lord preserveth the strangers; he relieveth the fatherless and widow: but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down. 

10  The Lord shall reign for ever, even thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye the Lord.
