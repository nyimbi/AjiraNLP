1  Praise ye the Lord. I will praise the Lord with my whole heart, in the assembly of the upright, and in the congregation. 

2  The works of the Lord are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein. 

3  His work is honourable and glorious: and his righteousness endureth for ever. 

4  He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: the Lord is gracious and full of compassion. 

5  He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be mindful of his covenant. 

6  He hath shewed his people the power of his works, that he may give them the heritage of the heathen. 

7  The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his commandments are sure. 

8  They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and uprightness. 

9  He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever: holy and reverend is his name. 

10  The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do his commandments: his praise endureth for ever.
